Description:
 This header defines flags which are used in the configuration of assembly instances.
 They control the behavior of an assembly towards the bus and towards the user.
 We distinguish type flags to determine the type of an assembly instance and option
 flags which optionally allow for control of the assembly instance's behavior.
 The definitions in this header contribute to the LFW API of the EtherNet/IP stack and
 are applicable to the DPM packet interface.
