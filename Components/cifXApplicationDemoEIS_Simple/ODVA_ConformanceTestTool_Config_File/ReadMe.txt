Go to www.odva.org for more information.

soc-File: Used for CT18 and newer
Note: CT17 and previous versions used *.stc files with a complete different format.

Note:
This soc file fits to the EtherNet/IP stack configuration that is applied in this demo.
Changes to the stack configuration (e.g. changing I/O sizes or assembly instances) also require adjustments to the soc file.
