Configuration file for EtherNet/IP Device Interoperability Test Tool (EDITT).
EDITT is used during the EtherNet/IP PlugFest event to perform the Common device and adapter test. 
It can be bought from Pyramid Solution at www.pyramidsolutions.com.

Note:
This *.dut file fits to the EtherNet/IP stack configuration that is applied in this demo.
Changes to the stack configuration (e.g. changing I/O sizes or assembly instances) require also adjustments to the *.dut file.
